Improvements:
Switch index convention
Memoization of things like rho and h_ascended
Do we still need pseudoserialization? Can we make it less ugly?
ModifiedBinaryLayer
isometric disentanglers

Fixes:
prints -> proper logging
pad_with_zeros_to should be changed to not break isometricity
clean up the _model files to some demo.jl type thing
set everything up as a Julia package: manifests, readme, directory structure, etc.
incorporate ternaryMERAinf_refine.jl into the demo files
remove all expanding of support for operators in demo_tools (at least magop)
implement proper computation of scaldims, with KrylovKit, for all MERA types
join BinaryLayer and TernaryLayer under a common supertype, maybe SimpleLayer or a Union type, to implement all methods that assume the layer is just a collection of tensors
