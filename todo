IMPROVEMENTS:
Switch index convention
Memoization of things like rho and h_ascended
Do we still need pseudoserialization? Can we make it less ugly?
ModifiedBinaryLayer
isometric disentanglers
transform many permuteind calls into ;s in index lists
add a function for evaluating two-point correlators
implement gradient descent
implement extrapolation

FIXES:
pad_with_zeros_to should be changed to not break isometricity
clean up the demo files and unify them as much as possible
