IMPROVEMENTS:
Switch index convention
Memoization of things like rho and h_ascended
Do we still need pseudoserialization? Can we make it less ugly?
ModifiedBinaryLayer
isometric disentanglers

FIXES:
pad_with_zeros_to should be changed to not break isometricity
set everything up as a Julia package: manifests, readme, directory structure, etc.
implement proper computation of scaldims, with KrylovKit, for all MERA types
clean up the _model files to some demo.jl type thing
incorporate ternaryMERAinf_refine.jl into the demo files
